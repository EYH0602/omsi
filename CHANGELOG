Version 1.2.4:

   Added timeout to configureSocket() in OmsiClient, so that if network
   traffic is heavy, client will give up trying to send file to server,
   and try again.  This way at least Mac users need not fear the dreaded
   "spinning rainbow disk."

   Server now will create a file LOGFILE, recording IP addresses of
   client connection actions.  File is stored in the same directory as
   the student answer files.

Version 1.2.5:

   Cleaned up configureSocket() a bit, putting 'try:' within a 'while'
   loop rather than recursing if error.

   Added this CHANGELOG.

Version 1.3.0:

   Check for VERSION file, to detect whether user has started from the
   OMSI directory.

   Changed Run command to Submit & Run.  Many students had been
   forgetting to submit after running (and some thought Submit meant
   Submit All).  Also get complete record of students' runs, e.g. for
   studies of debugging etc.

   Added time-of-day to printed output from server.

Version 1.6.0/1.6.1:

   Converted to Python 3.

   All server actions saved to InstructorDirectory/LOGFILE, obviating
   need to run Unix 'script" command.

   Fix the remote shell vulnerability.

   Font size change for Answer Box; 14 was too small for sans-serief.
