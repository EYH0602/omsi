#AutoGradeQuiz.py
#Auto-grading program based on Norm Matloff's AutoGradeQuiz.R
#program.  Translated into Python by Kiran Bhadury.
#
#Update 11/2/15: Files are now expected to be stored in a hierarchical
#	directory format.  Each student has their own directory with their
#	answer file and any other files inside.
#
#Update 11/4/15: Now supports multi-line answers.  Assumes that any
#	line starting with a '#' is the question header, and any other
#	line is part of the corresponding answer.
#
#TODO:
#	How do we get/use the teacher's global variables?
#	Can't run R code (more details in the grade_student_ans function)
#	Doesn't currently support complex code evaluation.
#		I definitely feel like we can use Prof. Chen's GradeBot to
#		do this.  However, if Prof. Matloff is against it, Python's
#		subprocess module allows us to run external programs.
#	Doesn't set letter grades.
#		I held off on this one because I want us to find a good
#		way to display class results (maybe a graph? or maybe
#		just show avg and median?).  In any case, it will be easy
#		to add code allowing the teacher to input letter grade
#		cutoffs.
#	Doesn't email results.
#		There's a few examples in the Python docs on how to use
#		the smtplib and the email packages to send emails.  I'm
#		not sure how to set up the local server or if it requires
#		passwords, so I'm holding off on this.  Also, this isn't
#		essential to the core prototype right now (we can add code to 
#		email the results later on.)
#
#About the program
#	This program allows for semi-automated grading by parsing students'
#	answers and parsing a master answer file, and then displaying
#	both sets of answers to the teacher.  The teacher then decides how
#	many points to award and applies any late penalties.  All results are
#	stored in an output file.
#
#Conditions:
#	The students' answer directories, the master answer file, and this program
#	must all be in the same directory.  The master answer file must be
#	named Answersx, where x is the test ID.  The students' files must be
#	in directories that are named according to their email address:
#		emailname, where email name is the email address without
#		the @ucdavis.edu (i.e. jsmith@ucdavis.edu -> jsmith)
#	Their answers must be stored in a file called answers.txt within
#	their student directory.
#
#	The files must be in a certain format (more on this is explained
#	in the methods below).
#
#	The program also alerts the teacher if there are any formatting errors, 
#	and the teacher must manually fix or grade those files.
#
#Detailed information about each method precedes the method declaration
